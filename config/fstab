# Don't copy this file to your fstab, your drive's UUID will not match mine and therefore you will fail to boot.
# As you can see, we have added defaults, commit=60 , noatime, noauto, x-systemd.automount for the home partition. You can find more about this on the arch wiki.
# And we have added discard because it increases swap performance. (probably?)
