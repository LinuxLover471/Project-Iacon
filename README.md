Project Iacon is a set of scripts made to help people setup their system faster and apply tweaks from the wiki after the initial installation from the arch wiki.

The features include-
Ask questions first, minimal distraction between the process.
Automatic GPU Driver Installation.
Performance tweaks from the Arch wiki. [ext4 is required for root and home partitions in order to perform them safely]
Automatic user creation.
Handle wrong inputs gracefully.

If you find that the script is malfunctioning then just create an issue and I will look into it.
Thanks for your support.
